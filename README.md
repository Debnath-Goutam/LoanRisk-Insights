- The project is done using Python, using Jupyter Notebook.
- The project is a practice of Exploratory Data Analysis
- The project is trying to figure out the factors that makes a loan application from a borrower 'risky' by studying a dataset of different historical factors.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Technologies Used

- pandas - version 1.5.3
- numpy - version 1.24.3
- seaborn - version 0.12.2
- matplotlib - version 3.7.1


## Conclusions
- The client has 14.55% of their total loans as charged off.
- Most of the borrowers of the client have taken a loan of $4,500 to $15,000.
- Majority of the loans have an interest rate between 10%-15%
- Most of the client’s borrowers have an annual income between $4,000 and $8,000 with maximum around the range of $5,900
- A - huge of bulk of loan application comes from borrowers having a rented or mortgaged house.
- The client’s borrowers prefer a 36months loan repayment term
- Borrowers having an annual income between $0-20,000 have the highest change of defaulting
- Loans given out at an interest rate of 16% and above have a history of getting charged off.
- Loan amounts higher than $28,000 also have a history of getting charged off.
- Borrowers having a grade of A have the least chance of defaulting which increases with Grade F and Grade G having the highest defaulters rescpectively.
